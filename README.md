## Instructions to run
1) To run the study, open the study_code folder and enter Study.Rproj. Open the code_to_run.R file, create your cdm references, and then source the analysis. Once the analysis is finished, you should have a single csv with your results that are ready to share.
2) To view your results, copy your results csv to the reporting folder. Then go into the reporting.Rproj, open results_summary.qmd, and then render. This should output a word document summarising your results.
